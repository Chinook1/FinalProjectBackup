For my Math program:

1. A function which will cut the number into bits. Send it 429: it will return 3 & 13 & 11. (Root)
2. Another function, use the above to figure out roots. The user sends a root and a number. (Root)
3. Try having function based on the Law of cosines. (LawCosines)
4. Function based on the Law of Sines. (LawSines)
5. Function which will return the size of an angle, if given the other two angles. (SumOfAngles)
6. Functions which do conversions. Radian/Degree, Celcius/Fahrenheit/Kelvin, ... (Conversion)
7. Solving for x with Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 (x = (-b +-)) (quadratic formula) (QuadraticEquation)
8. Solving Direction Fields. (DirectionFields) It doesn't graph, but neg means down, pos up.
9. Get area using the Side-Angle-Side Formula. (TrigArea)
10. Get area using Heron's Formula. (TrigArea)
11. Solve the recurrence relation. (RecurrenceRelation).
12. Get amount of money will owe or gain with the simple interest formula. (Interest)
13. Get amount of money will owe or gain with the compound interest formula. (Interest)

******************************************************
Consider checking up triginometry for more problems.

14. Maybe even some stuff from Discrete. Maybe the logic design stuff? Probably too difficult.
A*A = A (* = AND), (+ = OR), A+A = A (' = NOT. If A is 1, A' = 0)

15. Also, create a function to deal with it. sqrt(-9) = 3i.

16. Consider trying to solve a Differential Equations problem which I coded into my graphing calculator.

If my old partner isn't taking the class this semester, could video how it works, and use that for demo.
